description "Computes local pair probabilities for base pairs with a maximal span\
 of L. The probabilities are averaged over all windows of size L that contain the\
 base pair. For a sequence of length n and a window size of L the algorithm uses\
 only O(n+L*L) memory and O(n*L*L) CPU time. Thus it is practical to \"scan\" very\
 large genomes for short stable RNA structures.\n"

flag
off
hidden

option  "binaries"  b
"Output accessibility profiles in binary format.\n"
details=" The binary files produced by RNAplfold do not need to be parsed\
 by RNAplex, so that they are directly loaded into memory. This is useful when large\
 sequences have to be searched for putative hybridization sites. Another advantage of\
 the binary format is the 50% file size decrease.\n\n"

option  "noconv"  -
"Do not automatically substitute nucleotide \"T\" with \"U\".\n\n"
flag
off

option  "auto-id"  -
"Automatically generate an ID for each sequence.\n"
details="The default mode of RNAplfold is to automatically determine an ID from the input sequence\
 data if the input file format allows to do that. Sequence IDs are usually given in the FASTA\
 header of input sequences. If this flag is active, RNAplfold ignores any IDs retrieved from the\
 input and automatically generates an ID for each sequence. This ID consists of a prefix and an\
 increasing number. This flag can also be used to add a FASTA header to the output even if\
 the input has none.\n\n"
flag
off

option  "id-prefix" -
"Prefix for automatically generated IDs (as used in output file names).\n"
details="If this parameter is set, each sequences' FASTA id will be prefixed\
 with the provided string. FASTA ids then take the form \">prefix_xxxx\" where\
 xxxx is the sequence number. Hence, the output files will obey the following naming\
 scheme: \"prefix_xxxx_dp.ps\" (dot-plot), \"prefix_xxxx_lunp\" (unpaired probabilities),\
 etc. Note: Setting this parameter implies --auto-id.\n\n"

option  "id-digits"  -
"Specify the number of digits of the counter in automatically generated alignment IDs.\n"
details="When alignments IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing number, starting\
 with 1. This number will always be left-padded by leading zeros, such that the number takes up a\
 certain width. Using this parameter, the width can be specified to the users need. We allow\
 numbers in the range [1:18]. This option implies --auto-id.\n\n"

option  "id-start"  -
"Specify the first number in automatically generated IDs.\n"
details="When sequence IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing number,\
 usually starting with 1. Using this parameter, the first number can be specified to the users\
 requirements. Note: negative numbers are not allowed.\nNote: Setting this parameter implies\

option  "filename-delim" -
"Change the delimiting character used in sanitized filenames.\n"
details="This parameter can be used to change the delimiting character used while\
 sanitizing filenames, i.e. replacing invalid characters. Note, that the default\
 delimiter ALWAYS is the first character of the \"ID delimiter\" as supplied through\
 the --id-delim option. If the delimiter is a whitespace character or empty, invalid\
 characters will be simply removed rather than substituted.\
 Currently, we regard the following characters as illegal for use in filenames:\
 backslash '\', slash '/', question mark '?', percent sign '%', asterisk '*', colon ':',\
 pipe symbol '|', double quote '\"', triangular brackets '<' and '>'.\n\n"
string
typestr="CHAR"
default="ID-delimiter"
optional
hidden

option  "filename-full" -
"Use full FASTA header to create filenames.\n"
details="This parameter can be used to deactivate the default behavior of limiting\
 output filenames to the first word of the sequence ID. Consider the following example:\
 An input with FASTA header '>NM_0001 Homo Sapiens some gene' usually produces output\
 files with the prefix \"NM_0001\" without the additional data available in the FASTA\
 header, e.g. \"NM_0001_ss.ps\" for secondary structure plots. With this flag set, no\
 truncation of the output filenames is done, i.e. output filenames receive the full\
 FASTA header data as prefixes. Note, however, that invalid characters (such as whitespace)\
 will be substituted by a delimiting character or simply removed, (see also the parameter\
 option --filename-delim).\n\n"

 'D': Convert by using the linear equation according to Deigan et al 2009. Derived pseudo energy terms\
 will be applied for every nucleotide involved in a stacked pair. This method is recognized by a capital\
 'D' in the provided parameter, i.e.: --shapeMethod=\"D\" is the default setting. The slope 'm' and the\
 intercept 'b' can be set to a non-default value if necessary, otherwise m=1.8 and b=-0.6. To alter these\
 parameters, e.g. m=1.9 and b=-0.7, use a parameter string like this: --shapeMethod=\"Dm1.9b-0.7\". You\
 may also provide only one of the two parameters like: --shapeMethod=\"Dm1.9\" or --shapeMethod=\"Db-0.7\".\n\n\
 'Z': Convert SHAPE reactivities to pseudo energies according to Zarringhalam et al 2012.\
 SHAPE reactivities will be converted to pairing probabilities by using linear mapping.\
 Aberration from the observed pairing probabilities will be penalized during the folding recursion.\
 The magnitude of the penalties can affected by adjusting the factor beta\
 (e.g. --shapeMethod=\"Zb0.8\").\n\n\
 'W': Apply a given vector of perturbation energies to unpaired nucleotides according to Washietl et al 2012.\

The following methods can be used to convert SHAPE reactivities into the probability for a certain nucleotide to be unpaired.\n
'M': Use linear mapping according to Zarringhalam et al.
'C': Use a cutoff-approach to divide into paired and unpaired nucleotides (e.g. \"C0.25\")
'S': Skip the normalizing step since the input data already represents probabilities for being unpaired rather than raw reactivity values
'L': Use a linear model to convert the reactivity into a probability for being unpaired (e.g. \"Ls0.68i0.2\" to use a slope of 0.68 and an intercept of 0.2)
'O': Use a linear model to convert the log of the reactivity into a probability for being unpaired (e.g. \"Os1.6i-2.29\" to use a slope of 1.6 and an intercept of -2.29)\n\n"
