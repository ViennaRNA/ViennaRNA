description "The program reads RNA sequences, calculates their minimum free energy (mfe) structure\
 and prints the mfe structure in bracket notation and its free energy. If not specified differently\
 using commandline arguments, input is accepted from stdin or read from an input file, and output\
 printed to stdout. If the -p option\
 was given it also computes the partition function (pf) and base pairing probability matrix, and\
 prints the free energy of the thermodynamic ensemble, the frequency of the mfe structure in the ensemble,\
 and the ensemble diversity to stdout.\n\nIt also produces PostScript files with plots of the resulting\
 secondary structure graph and a \"dot plot\" of the base pairing matrix.\nThe dot plot shows a matrix of\
 squares with area proportional to the pairing probability in the upper right half, and one square for each\
 pair in the minimum free energy structure in the lower left half. For each pair i-j with probability\
 p>10E-6 there is a line of the form\n\ni  j  sqrt(p)  ubox\n\nin the PostScript file, so that the pair\
 probabilities can be easily extracted.\n\nSequences may be provided in a simple text format where each sequence\
 occupies a single line. Output files are named \"rna.ps\" and \"dot.ps\". Existing files of the same name\
 will be overwritten.\n\nIt is also possible to provide sequence data in FASTA format. In this case, the\
 first word of the FASTA header will be used as prefix for output file names. PostScript files \"prefix_ss.ps\"\
 and \"prefix_dp.ps\" are produced for the structure and dot plot, respectively. Note, however, that once\
 FASTA input was provided all following sequences must be in FASTA format too.\n\nTo avoid problems with\
 certain operating systems and/or file systems the prefix will ALWAYS be sanitized!\
 This step substitutes any special character in the prefix by a filename delimiter. See the --filename-delim\
 option to change the delimiting character according to your requirements.\n\nThe program will continue to\
 read new sequences until a line consisting of the single character @ or an end of file (EOF) condition is\
 encountered.\n\n"

option  "jobs"  j
"Split batch input into jobs and start processing in parallel using multiple threads. A value of 0\
 indicates to use as many parallel threads as computation cores are available.\n"
details="Default processing of input data is performed in a serial fashion, i.e. one sequence at\
 a time. Using this switch, a user can instead start the computation for many sequences in the\
 input in parallel. RNAfold will create as many parallel computation slots as specified and\
 assigns input sequences of the input file(s) to the available slots. Note, that this increases\
 memory consumption since input alignments have to be kept in memory until an empty compute slot\
 is available and each running job requires its own dynamic programming matrices.\n\n"

option  "unordered"  -
"Do not try to keep output in order with input while parallel processing is in place.\n"
details="When parallel input processing (--jobs flag) is enabled, the order in which input\
 is processed depends on the host machines job scheduler. Therefore, any output to stdout\
 or files generated by this program will most likely not follow the order of the corresponding\
 input data set. The default of RNAfold is to use a specialized data structure to still keep\
 the results output in order with the input data. However, this comes with a trade-off in terms\
 of memory consumption, since all output must be kept in memory for as long as no chunks\
 of consecutive, ordered output are available. By setting this flag, RNAfold will not buffer\
 individual results but print them as soon as they have been computated.\n\n"

 the input sequences and the --auto-id feature is inactive. Otherwise, output files with\
 the scheme \"prefix.fold\" are generated, where the \"prefix\" is taken from the sequence\
 id, e.g. the FASTA header. The user may specify a single output file name for all data\
 generated from the input by supplying a filename as argument following immediately\
 after this parameter.\nIn case a file with the same filename already exists, any output of\
 the program will be appended to it.\

 header of input sequences. If this flag is active, RNAfold ignores any IDs retrieved from the\

 files with the prefix \"NM_0001\" without the additional data available in the FASTA\
 header, e.g. \"NM_0001_ss.ps\" for secondary structure plots. With this flag set, no\
 truncation of the output filenames is done, i.e. output filenames receive the full\

 'D' in the provided parameter, i.e.: --shapeMethod=\"D\" is the default setting. The slope 'm' and the\

 'Z': Convert SHAPE reactivities to pseudo energies according to Zarringhalam et al 2012.\
 SHAPE reactivities will be converted to pairing probabilities by using linear mapping.\
 Aberration from the observed pairing probabilities will be penalized during the folding recursion.\

 essentially unpaired, weakly paired, strongly paired without preference, weakly upstream (downstream) paired,\
 or strongly up- (down-)stream paired bases, respectively. On the next line the centroid structure as derived\
 from the pair probabilities together with its free energy and distance to the ensemble is shown. Finally it\
 prints the frequency of the mfe structure, and the\
