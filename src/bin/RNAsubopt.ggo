description "reads RNA sequences from stdin and (in the default -e mode) calculates all suboptimal secondary\
 structures within a user defined energy range above the minimum free energy (mfe). It prints the suboptimal\
 structures in dot-bracket notation followed by the energy in kcal/mol to stdout. Be careful, the number of\
 structures returned grows exponentially with both sequence length and energy range.\n\nAlternatively, when\
 used with the -p option, RNAsubopt produces Boltzmann weighted samples of secondary structures.\n"

"Do not automatically substitude nucleotide \"T\" with \"U\"\n\n"
flag

option  "infile"  i
"Read a file instead of reading from stdin\n"
details="The default behavior of RNAsubopt is to read input from stdin. Using this parameter\
 the user can specify an input file name where data is read from.\n\n"
string
typestr="<filename>"
optional

option  "outfile" o
"Print output to file instead of stdout\n"
details="This option may be used to write all output to output files rather than printing\
 to stdout. The default filename is \"RNAsubopt_output.sub\" if no FASTA header precedes\
 the input sequences and the --auto-id feature is inactive. Otherwise, output files with\
 the scheme \"prefix.sub\" are generated, where the \"prefix\" is taken from the sequence\
 id. The user may specify a single output file name for all data generated from the input\
 by supplying an optional string as argument to this parameter. In case a file with the same\
 filename already exists, any output of the program will be appended to it.\
 Note: Any special characters in the filename will be replaced by the filename delimiter,\
 hence there is no way to pass an entire directory path through this option yet.\
 (See also the \"--filename-delim\" parameter)\n\n"

option  "auto-id"  -
"Automatically generate an ID for each sequence.\n"
details="The default mode of RNAsubopt is to automatically determine an ID from the input sequence\
 data if the input file format allows to do that. Sequence IDs are usually given in the FASTA\
 header of input sequences. If this flag is active, RNAsubopt ignores any IDs retrieved from the\
 input and automatically generates an ID for each sequence. This ID consists of a prefix and an\
 increasing number. This flag can also be used to add a FASTA header to the output even if\
 the input has none.\n\n"

off

option  "id-prefix" -
"Prefix for automatically generated IDs (as used in output file names)\n\n"
details="If this parameter is set, each sequences' FASTA id will be prefixed\
 with the provided string. FASTA ids then take the form \">prefix_xxxx\" where\
 xxxx is the sequence number. Note: Setting this parameter implies --auto-id.\n\n"

option  "id-digits"  -
"Specify the number of digits of the counter in automatically generated alignment IDs.\n"
details="When alignments IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing number, starting\
 with 1. This number will always be left-padded by leading zeros, such that the number takes up a\
 certain width. Using this parameter, the width can be specified to the users need. We allow\
 numbers in the range [1:18]. This option implies --auto-id.\n\n"

details="When sequence IDs are automatically generated, they receive an increasing number,\
 usually starting with 1. Using this parameter, the first number can be specified to the users\
 requirements. Note: negative numbers are not allowed.\nNote: Setting this parameter implies\
 to ignore any IDs retrieved from the input data, i.e. it activates the --auto-id flag.\n\n"

option  "filename-delim" -
"Change the delimiting character that is used for sanitized filenames\n\n"
details="This parameter can be used to change the delimiting character used while\
 sanitizing filenames, i.e. replacing invalid characters. Note, that the default\
 delimiter ALWAYS is the first character of the \"ID delimiter\" as supplied through\
 the --id-delim option. If the delimiter is a whitespace character or empty, invalid\
 characters will be simply removed rather than substituted.\
 Currently, we regard the following characters as illegal for use in filenames:\
 backslash '\', slash '/', question mark '?', percent sign '%', asterisk '*', colon ':',\
 pipe symbol '|', double quote '\"', triangular brackets '<' and '>'.\n\n"

option  "filename-full" -
"Use full FASTA header to create filenames\n\n"
details="This parameter can be used to deactivate the default behavior of limiting\
 output filenames to the first word of the sequence ID. Consider the following example:\
 An input with FASTA header \">NM_0001 Homo Sapiens some gene\" usually produces output\
 files with the prefix \"NM_0001\" without the additional data available in the FASTA\
 header, e.g. \"NM_0001.sub\". With this flag set, no truncation of the output filenames\
 is performed, i.e. output filenames receive the full FASTA header data as prefixes. Note,\
 however, that invalid characters (such as whitespace) will be substituted by a delimiting\
 character or simply removed, (see also the parameter option --filename-delim).\n\n"

details="The following methods can be used to convert SHAPE reactivities into pseudo energy contributions.\n
'D': Convert by using a linear equation according to Deigan et al 2009. \
The calculated pseudo energies will be applied for every nucleotide involved in a stacked pair. \
This method is recognized by a capital 'D' in the provided parameter, i.e.: \
--shapeMethod=\"D\" is the default setting. The slope 'm' and the intercept 'b' can be set to a \
non-default value if necessary, otherwise m=1.8 and b=-0.6. \
To alter these parameters, e.g. m=1.9 and b=-0.7, use a \
parameter string like this: --shapeMethod=\"Dm1.9b-0.7\". You may also provide only one of the two \
parameters like: --shapeMethod=\"Dm1.9\" or --shapeMethod=\"Db-0.7\".

'Z': Convert SHAPE reactivities to pseudo energies according to Zarringhalam et al 2012. \
SHAPE reactivities will be converted to pairing probabilities by using linear mapping. \
Aberration from the observed pairing probabilities will be penalized during the folding recursion. \
The magnitude of the penalties can affected by adjusting the factor beta \
(e.g. --shapeMethod=\"Zb0.8\").

'W': Apply a given vector of perturbation energies to unpaired nucleotides according to Washietl et al 2012. \
Perturbation vectors can be calculated by using RNApvmin.\n\n"

'M': Use linear mapping according to Zarringhalam et al.
'C': Use a cutoff-approach to divide into paired and unpaired nucleotides (e.g. \"C0.25\")
'S': Skip the normalizing step since the input data already represents probabilities for being unpaired rather than raw reactivity values
'L': Use a linear model to convert the reactivity into a probability for being unpaired (e.g. \"Ls0.68i0.2\" to use a slope of 0.68 and an intercept of 0.2)
'O': Use a linear model to convert the log of the reactivity into a probability for being unpaired (e.g. \"Os1.6i-2.29\" to use a slope of 1.6 and an intercept of -2.29)\n\n"

 dangling ends altogether (mostly for debugging).\nWith -d3 mfe folding will allow coaxial stacking\
 of adjacent helices in multi-loops. At the moment the implementation will not allow coaxial stacking\
 of the two interior pairs in a loop of degree 3 and works only for mfe folding.\n\nNote that with\
