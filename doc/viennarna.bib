The combinatorial theory of RNA structures and the dynamic programming algorithms for RNA secondary structure prediction are extended here to incorporate G-quadruplexes. Using a simple but plausible energy model for quadruplexes, we find that the overwhelming majority of putative quadruplex-forming sequences in the human genome are likely to fold into canonical secondary structures instead.}

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Secondary structure forms an important intermediate level of description of nucleic acids that encapsulates the dominating part of the folding energy, is often well conserved in evolution, and is routinely used as a basis to explain experimental findings. Based on carefully measured thermodynamic parameters exact dynamic programming algorithms can be used to compute ground states, base pairing probabilities, as well as thermodynamic properties.\\
            RESULTS: The ViennaRNA Package has been a widely used compilation of RNA secondary structure related computer programs for nearly two decades. Major changes in the structure of the standard energy model, the Turner 2004 parameters, the pervasive use of multi-core CPUs, and an increasing number of algorithmic variants prompted a major technical overhaul of both the underlying RNAlib and the interactive user programs. New features include an expanded repertoire of tools to assess RNA-RNA interactions and restricted ensembles of structures, additional output information such as centroid structures and maximum expected accuracy structures derived from base pairing probabilities, or z-scores for locally stable secondary structures, and support for input in fasta format. Updates were implemented without compromising the computational efficiency of the core algorithms and ensuring compatibility with earlier versions.\\

  abstract  = {The analysis of RNA folding landscapes yields insights into the kinetic folding
behavior not available from classical structure prediction methods. This is especially
important for multi-stable RNAs whose function is related to structural changes,
as in the case of riboswitches. However, exact methods such as barrier tree analysis
scale exponentially with sequence length. Here we present an algorithm that computes
a projection of the energy landscape into two dimensions, namely the distances
to two reference structures. This yields an abstraction of the high-dimensional energy
landscape that can be conveniently visualized, and can serve as the basis for estimating
energy barriers and refolding pathways. With an asymptotic time complexity of O(n^7)
the algorithm is computationally demanding. However, by exploiting the sparsity of
the dynamic programming matrices and parallelization for multi-core processors, our
implementation is practical for sequences of up to 400 nt, which includes most RNAs
of biological interest.}

year="2016",

pages="1--13",
abstract={BACKGROUND: A large class of RNA secondary structure prediction programs uses an elaborate energy model grounded in extensive thermodynamic measurements and exact dynamic programming algorithms. External experimental evidence can be in principle be incorporated by means of hard constraints that restrict the search space or by means of soft constraints that distort the energy model. In particular recent advances in coupling chemical and enzymatic probing with sequencing techniques but also comparative approaches provide an increasing amount of experimental data to be combined with secondary structure prediction.
RESULTS: Responding to the increasing needs for a versatile and user-friendly inclusion of external evidence into diverse flavors of RNA secondary structure prediction tools we implemented a generic layer of constraint handling into the ViennaRNA Package. It makes explicit use of the conceptual separation of the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìfolding grammar√¢‚Ç¨¬ù defining the search space and the actual energy evaluation, which allows constraints to be interleaved in a natural way between recursion steps and evaluation of the standard energy function.
CONCLUSIONS: The extension of the ViennaRNA Package provides a generic way to include diverse types of constraints into RNA folding algorithms. The computational overhead incurred is negligible in practice. A wide variety of application scenarios can be accommodated by the new framework, including the incorporation of structure probing data, non-standard base pairs and chemical modifications, as well as structure-dependent ligand binding.},

abstract ={Summary: Chemical mapping experiments allow for nucleotide resolution assessment of RNA structure. We demonstrate that different strategies of integrating probing data with thermodynamics-based RNA secondary structure prediction algorithms can be implemented by means of soft constraints. This amounts to incorporating suitable pseudo-energies into the standard energy model for RNA secondary structures. As a showcase application for this new feature of the ViennaRNA Package we compare three distinct, previously published strategies to utilize SHAPE reactivities for structure prediction. The new tool is benchmarked on a set of RNAs with known reference structure.Availability and implementation: The capability for SHAPE directed RNA folding is part of the upcoming release of the ViennaRNA Package 2.2, for which a preliminary release is already freely available at http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA.Contact: michael.wolfinger@univie.ac.atSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
