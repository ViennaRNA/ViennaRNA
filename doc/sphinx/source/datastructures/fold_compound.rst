The 'Fold Compound'
===================

This module provides interfaces that deal with the most basic data structure used
in structure predicting and energy evaluating function of the RNAlib.

Throughout the entire RNAlib, the #vrna_fold_compound_t, is used to group
information and data that is required for structure prediction and energy evaluation.
Here, you'll find interface functions to create, modify, and delete :c:type:`vrna_fold_compound_t`
data structures.
