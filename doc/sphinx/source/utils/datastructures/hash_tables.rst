Hash Tables
===========

Various implementations of hash table functions.

Hash tables are common data structures that allow for fast random
access to the data that is stored within.

Here, we provide an abstract implementation of a hash table interface
and a concrete implementation for pairs of secondary structure and
corresponding free energy value.
