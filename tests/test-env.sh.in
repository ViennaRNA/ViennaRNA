# include current directory into our Python path variable
PYTHONPATH='.:${PYTHONPATH}'

export PYTHONPATH

# include path to the built executables to check their functionality later on
PATH=@top_builddir@/src/bin:${PATH}

export PATH

# the path to various data files required to run our tests
export DATADIR=@srcdir@/data

# current ViennaRNA Package version
export CURRENT_VERSION=@VERSION@

# set DIFF variable
