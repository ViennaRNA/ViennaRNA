.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAalifold
reads aligned RNA sequences from stdin or \fIfile.aln\fP and calculates
their minimum free energy (mfe) structure, partition function (pf) and base
pairing probability matrix. Currently, the input alignment has to be in
CLUSTAL format. It returns the mfe structure in bracket notation, its
energy, the free energy of the thermodynamic ensemble and the frequency of
the mfe structure in the ensemble to stdout.  It also produces Postscript
files with plots of the resulting secondary structure graph ("alirna.ps")
and a "dot plot" of the base pairing matrix ("alidot.ps"). The file
"alifold.out" will contain a list of likely pairs sorted by credibility,
suitable for viewing  with "AliDot.pl".
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
.B \-cv \fIfactor\fP
Set the weight of the covariance term in the energy function to
\fIfactor\fP. Default is 1.
.TP 
.B \-nc \fIfactor\fP
Set the penalty for non\-compatible sequences in the covariance term of the
energy function to \fIfactor\fP. Default is 1.
.TP 
.B \-E
Score pairs with endgaps same as gap-gap pairs.
.TP 
.B \-mis
Output "most informative sequence" instead of simple consensus: For each 
column of the alignment output the set of nucleotides with frequence greater 
than average in IUPAC notation.
.TP 
.B \-p
Calculate the partition function and base pairing probability matrix in
addition to the mfe structure. Default is calculation of mfe structure only.
.TP 
.B \-noLP
Avoid structures without lonely pairs (helices of length 1). In the mfe
case structures with lonely pairs are strictly forbidden. For partition
function folding this disallows pairs that can \fBonly\fP occur isolated.
Setting this option provides a significant speedup.
.TP
.B \-circ
Assume circular (instead of linear) RNA molecules. Currently works only
for mfe folding.
.PP 
The \fB\-T\fP, \fB\-d\fP, \fB\-4\fP, \fB\-noGU\fP, \fB\-noCloseGU\fP,
\fB\-e\fP, \fB\-P\fP, \fB\-nsp\fP, options \fUshould\fP work as in RNAfold

If using \fB\-C\fP constraints will be read from stdin, the alignment
has to given as a filename on the command line. 

.SH "CAVEATS"
Since gaps are not removed for the evaluation of energies, it may be
of advantage to remove any columns with more than, say, 75% gaps from
the alignment before folding with RNAalifold.

Sequences are not weighted. If possible, do not mix very similar and
dissimilar sequences. Duplicate sequences, for example, can distort the
prediction.

aligned sequences with covariance information.
