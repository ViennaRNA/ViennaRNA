.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I RNAfold
reads RNA sequences from stdin and calculates their minimum free energy
(mfe) structure, partition function (pf) and base pairing probability
matrix. It returns the mfe structure in bracket notation, its energy, the
free energy of the thermodynamic ensemble and the frequency of the mfe
structure in the ensemble to stdout.  It also produces PostScript files
with plots of the resulting secondary structure graph and a "dot plot" of
the base pairing matrix.  The dot plot shows a matrix of squares with area
proportional to the pairing probability in the upper half, and one square
for each pair in the minimum free energy structure in the lower half. For
each pair i-j with probability p>10E-6 there is a line of the form
.br
i  j  sqrt(p)  ubox
.br
in the PostScript file, so that the pair probabilities can be easily
extracted. 
If the sequence is preceded by a line of the form
.br
> name
.br
then the PostScript files name_ss.ps and name_dp.ps are produced for
the structure and dot plot, respectively. Otherwise the filenames
default to rna.ps and dot.ps. Existing files of the same name will be
overwritten.
.br
The program will continue to read new sequences until a line consisting
of the single character @ or an end of file condition is encountered.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-p
Calculate the partition function and base pairing probability matrix in
addition to the mfe structure. Default is calculation of mfe structure only.
.TP
.B \-p0
Calculate the pf without pairing matrix and print the ensemble free energy
-kT ln(Z). This is much faster.
.TP
.B \-C
Calculate structures subject to constraints. 
The programm reads first the sequence then the a string containg constraints 
on the structure encoded with the symbols:  
. (no constraint for this base)
| (the corresponding base has to be paired
x (the base is unpaired)
< (base i is paired with a base j>i)
> (base i is paired with a base j<i)
and matching brackets ( ) (base i pairs base j)
Pf folding ignores constraints of type "|" "<" and ">", but disallow all
pairs conflicting with a constraint of type "x" or "( )". This is usually
sufficient to enforce the constraint.
.TP
.B \-T\ \fItemp\fP
Rescale energy parameters to a temperature of \fItemp\fP C. Default is 37C.
.TP
.B \-4
Do not include special stabilizing energies for certain tetraloops.
.TP
.B \-d[2]
How to treat "dangling end" energies for bases adjacent to helices in free
ends and multiloops: Normally only unpaired bases can participate in at
most one dangling end. With \fB-d2\fP this check is ignored, this is the
default for partition function folding (-p). \fB-d\fP ignores dangling ends
altogether. Note that by default pf and mfe folding treat dangling ends
differently, use -d2 (or -d) in addition to -p to ensure that both
algorithms use the same energy model.  
.TP
.B \-noGU
Do not allow GU pairs.
.TP
.B \-noCloseGU
Do not allow GU pairs at the end of helices.
.TP
.B \-e\ \fI1|2\fP
Rarely used option to fold sequences from the artificial ABCD... alphabet,
where A pairs B, C-D etc.  Use the energy parameters for GC (-e 1) or AU
(-e 2) pairs.
.TP
.B \-P\ \fIparamfile\fP
Read energy parameters from \fIparamfile\fP, instead of using the default
parameter set. A sample parameterfile should accompany your distribution.
See the RNAlib documentation for details on the file format.
.TP
.B \-nsp  \fIpairs\fP
Allow other pairs in addition to the usual AU,GC,and GU pairs. \fIpairs\fP 
is a comma seperated list of additionally allowed pairs. If a the first 
character is a '-' then AB will imply that AB and BA are allowed pairs.
e.g. RNAfold -nsp -GA  will allow GA and AG pairs. Nonstandard pairs are 
given 0 stacking energy.
.TP
.B \-S\ \fIscale\fP
In the calculation of the pf use \fIscale\fP*mfe as an estimate for the
ensemble free energy (used to avoid overflows). The default is 1.07,
usefull values are 1.0 to 1.2. Occasionally needed for long sequences.
You can also recompile the programm to use double precision (see the README
file).
