.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAcofold
works much like RNAfold, but allows to specify two RNA sequences wich are
then allowed to form a dimer structure. RNA sequences are read from stdin
in the usual format. To compute the hybrid structure of two molecules, the
two sequences must be concatenated using the '&' character as separator.
RNAcofold can compute minimum free energy (mfe) structures, as well as
partition function (pf) and base pairing probability matrix (using the
-p switch). 
.br
Since dimer formation is concentration dependent, RNAcofold can be used
to compute equilibrium concentrations for all five monomer and
(homo/hetero)-dimer species, given input concentrations for the monomers.
.br
Output consists of the mfe structure in bracket notation as well as PostScript
structure plots and "dot plot" files containing the pair probabilities, see
the RNAfold man page for details. In the dot plots a cross marks the chain
break between the two concatenated sequences. 
.br 
The program will continue to read new sequences until a line consisting
of the single character @ or an end of file condition is encountered.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-a
Compute the partition function and free energies not only of the
hetero-dimer consisting of the two input sequences (the "AB dimer"), 
but also of the homo-dimers AA and BB as well as A and B monomers.
The output will contain the free energies for each of these species,
as well as 5 dot plots containing the conditional pair probabilities,
called ABname5.ps, AAname5.ps and so on. For later use, these dot plot
files also contain the free energy of the ensemble as a comment. Using
\fB\-a\fP automatically toggles the 
\fB\-p\fP option.  
.TP
.B \-c
In addition to everything listed under the \fB\-a\fP option, read in
initial monomer concentrations and compute the expected equilibrium
concentrations of the 5 possible species (AB, AA, BB, A, B). Start
concentrations are read from stdin (unless the -f option is
used) in [mol/l], equilibrium concentrations are given realtive to the
sum of the two inputs. An arbitrary number of initial concentrations
can be specified (one pair of concentrations per line).
.TP 
.B \-f\ \fIconcfile\fP
Specify a file with initial concentrations for the to sequences. The table
consits of arbitrary many lines with just two numbers (the concentration of
sequence A and B). Will automatically toggle the \fB\-c\fP (and thus
\fB\-a\fP and \fB\-p\fP) options (see above).
.PP
the \-p, \-p0, \-noGU, \-noCloseGU, \-nsp, \-S, \-e, \-P, \-noLP, \-T, \-4,
\-d and \-C options work as in \fBRNAfold\fP, see there for description.
