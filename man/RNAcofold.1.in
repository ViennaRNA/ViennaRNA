.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.I RNAcofold
works much like RNAfold, but allows to specify two RNA sequences wich are
then allowed to form a dimer structure. RNA sequences are read from stdin
in the usual format. To compute the hybrid structure of two molecules, the
two sequences must be concatenated using the '&' character as separator.
RNAcofold can compute minimum free energy (mfe) structures, as well as partition
function (pf) and base pairing probability matrix (using the -p switch).
.br
Output consists of the mfe structure in bracket notation as well as PostScript
structure plots and "dot plot" files containing the pair probabilities, see
the RNAfold man page for details. In the dot plots a cross marks the chain
break between the two concatenated sequences. 
.br 
The program will continue to read new sequences until a line consisting
of the single character @ or an end of file condition is encountered.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-a
Compute the partition function and free energies not only of the
hetero-dimer consisting of the two input sequences (the "AB dimer"), 
but also of the homo-dimers AA and BB as well as A and B monomers.
The output will contain the free energies in stdout, as well as 5 dot
plots, called ABname5.ps, AAname5.ps and so on. For later use, these
dot plot files contain the free energy of the ensemble as a comment.
Note that using \fB\-a\fP will automatically toggle the \fB\-p\fP option.
.TP
.B \-c
Will automatically toggle \fB\-a\fP and \fB\-p\fP (see \fB\-a\fP for
reference), but can additionally compute the expected concentrations of the
5 possible species (AB, AA, BB, A, B) out of start concentrations of A and
B. Starting concentrations can be either read from stdin, or from a file
using the \fB-f\fP option. In addition to all output produced by \fB-a\fP
it prints a table with initial monomer concentrations and resulting
equilibrium concentrations of the 5 species.
.TP 
.B \-f\ \fIconcfile\fP
Specify a file with initial concentrations for the to sequences. The table
consits of arbitrary many lines with just two numbers (the concentration of
sequence A and B). Will automatically toggle \fB\-a\fP, \fB\-c\fP and
\fB\-p\fP option (see above)  
.PP
the \-p, \-p0, \-noGU, \-noCloseGU, \-nsp, \-S, \-e, \-P, \-noLP, \-T, \-4,
\-d and \-C options work as in \fBRNAfold\fP, see there for description.
